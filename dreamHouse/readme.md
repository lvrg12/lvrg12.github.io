Project 1: Dream House Report

Virtual House: lvrg12.github.io/dreamHouse/
Video: 

The goal of this project was to design and create our dream house utilizing the current virtual
reality development tools. In this case I implemented my project with html, javascript, Three.JS,
and A-Frame.

The rooms that I created are based on my grandmother's house. The interior design is completely
renovated. After making some sketches on paper I started the implementation process by creating
the foundation and all the walls. These were done with a-boxes.

I continued by creating two counters and two isles in the kitchen. These were also made with
A-boxes. After this I started to apply textures to the walls, floors, and counters. I particularly
liked the counter design because it almost looks like a downloaded model.

Once I had found the texture for my "statement wall" I decided to design and furnish the living
room in a modern style, following a red/black theme. Thus, I put 3 gray couches around a crystal
coffee table. The TV is in front with its TV stand under. Since I used a lot of squares for the
wall, counters, and floor, I decided to put a carpet with a curvy pattern. This carpet was 
implemented using an a-plane, along with the flag on the wall. Other than these planes, all
objects in the living room are downloaded models.

I continued with the double counter and the kitchen. I believe this counter to be the most important
part of the house. I kept the black tiles just as it was in real life and I added modern bar stools
in both sides. The cabinets of the kitchen are all in one model. The fridge and the large pan
are single models which I scrupulously placed around the kitchen. Also at the very front of the
kitchen there is the dining table which as well has a modern style.

Furthermore, I decorated the hallway. It has a bookcase in the far left, a double entrance
door, a light switch and a small light to see it, and a piano. I had intented for the all the
lights to be off at the beginning of the application and to let the user click the switch, as
it would be the only object illuminated, to turn them all on. For the piano I had intented for it
to play music if clicked on by the user.

Finally I placed 4 the ceiling lamps in the middle of the living room, enough to illuminate the
whole house. Two of this lamps produce point type light while the other two produce ambient type
light. The reason for this is because the kitchen cabinets reflect a big amount of light to the
point they are not visible. Nevertheless, point light illuminates the room in a more natural way
than ambient light which weardly illumanates everything evenly. Therefore, I opted for a combination
of both types of lights.

It is important to mention that a user is able to walk through the room with no complication. This
gives an actual sense of virtual reality. Also, by utilizing the many resources of A-Frame, I was able
to design and virtually create a large environment. Feel free to inspect it using the links above.
